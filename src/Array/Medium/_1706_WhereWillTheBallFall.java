1. when the ball is dropping from top-left, we need to think about
3 cases:
1) the adjacent cell has the same direct of board, then ball goes to next
   level (i+1, j+1)
2) if the adjacent cell has opposite direct of board, then ball will be stuck
3) the ball was stuck by the wall on the rightmost side

2. when the ball is dropping from top-right, we also need to think about
3 cases:
1) the adjacent cell has the same direct of board, then ball goes to next
   level (i+1, j-1)
2) if the adjacent cell has opposite direct of board, then ball will be stuck
3) the ball was stuck by the wall on the leftmost side
